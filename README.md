# Live translation

**This module has been archived, it’s no longer maintained but you still can fork it if you need it for your shop.**

## About

Live translation module with Crowdin integration!

Contribute to the translation of PrestaShop directly from your own shop and administration panel.

​These translations will be shared with the PrestaShop community as part of the [Crowdin translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official).
​To translate your theme and shop for your own use, please go to International > Translations instead.
This module is not meant to help you translate your own shop, but to help with the community translations.

## How to use the module

1. Log in to your Crowdin account
2. Go to the Live translation module configuration
3. Click on "Translate" for either back or front office
4. Translate
5. Click on "Disable" when you're done translating. Do not forget this last part ^^
